Ratio->
     1. PE Ratio -> price to earning.
     2. PB Ration -> price to book value.
     3. Debt to equaty Ratio.

check this Ratio for basic analysis 

--------------> PE Ratio(Price to earning) - -----------------
             value of share price / earning from one share = PE ratio
company A    1000                   100                    = 10 
company B    2000                   100                    = 20

basic common sence toh ye bolti hai ki PE sasta hai company sasti hai.
                                       PE mehnga hai company mehngi hai.

** but this is not that simple as it looks

so what PE is if company is earning 100 per year so how much money
i am giving for that earning which is 1000.

how much money to give depends upon future earnings

mehnga pe is also not bad sometimes its good 
agar company bhot earn kregi toh mehnga PE sasta bhi hoga

agar company apna profit bhot teji se bhadati hai toh kuch farak nahi
padhta share ko kitne bhi mehnge P/E pr lelo kyoki apke buying price pe uska
P/E bhot km hojayega.

jaise jaise profit bhadega P/E km hota jayega.

agar koi company apna profit earning km km krke bhada rahi hai toh market usko
waise hi km P/E de deta hai 

if earning is uncertain then P/E is also uncertain.
P/E dega dhoka.

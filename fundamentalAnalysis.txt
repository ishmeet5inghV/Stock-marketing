thing im buying is expensive or not.

part 1 ---> value investing -> jb kissi bhi stock ko uski intrinsic value se km me kharid lena

* intrinsic value se km, buy

Ratio->
     1. PE Ratio -> price to earning. <<<<
     2. PB Ration -> price to book value. <<<<<
     3. Debt to equity Ratio. <<<<
     4. Current Ratio. >>>>

check this Ratio for basic analysis 

--------------> PE Ratio(Price to earning) - -----------------
             value of share price / earning from one share = PE ratio
company A    1000                   100                    = 10 
company B    2000                   100                    = 20

basic common sence toh ye bolti hai ki PE sasta hai company sasti hai.
                                       PE mehnga hai company mehngi hai.

** but this is not that simple as it looks

so what PE is if company is earning 100 per year so how much money
i am giving for that earning which is 1000.

how much money to give depends upon future earnings

mehnga pe is also not bad sometimes its good 
agar company bhot earn kregi toh mehnga PE sasta bhi hoga

agar company apna profit bhot teji se bhadati hai toh kuch farak nahi
padhta share ko kitne bhi mehnge P/E pr lelo kyoki apke buying price pe uska
P/E bhot km hojayega.

jaise jaise profit bhadega P/E km hota jayega.

agar koi company apna profit earning km km krke bhada rahi hai toh market usko
waise hi km P/E de deta hai 

if earning is uncertain then P/E is also uncertain.
P/E dega dhoka.

-----------------> P.B.ratio (price to book ratio)--------------------

Price to book ratio = share price / B.V per share.

**PE ratio -ve loss

share price - market price chal raha hai
B.V. = assets - liabilities 100 - 50 = 50
 
B.V. per share = B.V. / total shares. 50/10 = 5

Price to book ratio = share price / B.V. per share. - 20 / 5 = 4

1 rs ke net assets ke liye 4 rs de rahe hai us share ko kharidne ke liye.

or example me hum 20 rs de rahe hai 5 rs ke assets kharidne ke liye 
4 guna paisa de rahe hai book value se

companies -> no IT companies cos assets are low
             ASSERS must be present. appreciated or depreciated check this also.


----------------> Debt to Equity ratio -------------------
 
 debt / equity 2, 10, 20 debt is more.
 debt is cheap
 equity is expensive
 no loan in starting


 ----------------->  Current ratio -----------------------

 Current assets / Current liabilities 20cr / 10cr 2 ratio is ok


--------------------------------------------------------------

******* Dividend Yield -> how much dividend company is giving

***** company ke paas aa kya raha hai or bach kya raha hai


***** go to stock screener -> you can select nifty 50 100 500 -> add filter
          filter like ratio(debt, cover interest, current ratio).

**** companies starter ---> promoters
if they want they can sell the share or take money on behave of their shares.
share ke budle paisa tb uthayente jb market se paisa nahi mil raha

share sell buy by the companies good thing
>> advance fundamental analysis >> important

Promoter holding trend

increase total promoter holding -----> good

low Pledged promoter holding -----> good 
          means promoter is not selling share
          vo paisa utha rahe hai share ke badale me

**** jaise hi kissi bhi company ke andar mutual fund ya foreign institutional invester
     enter krte hai uska share bhagega 
     kyoki jb koi foreign institute paise dalta hai generally vo jada paise dalta hai
     
 

**** check the free cash flow
     increasing or not if yes good
